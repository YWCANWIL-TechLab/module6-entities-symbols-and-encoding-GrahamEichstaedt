            <h1>Exercise 2: Entities</h1>
            <p>
                Let's practice creating some entities. We have many more characters than we have 
                keys on our keyboards. Learning how to use these entities will allow us to access the 
                rest of the characters available to us. We do not need to know every single character,
                but it would be a good idea to learn the ones that come up the most. You can find a 
                list of some important ones 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">here</a>.
